On the left is the disk $D = \{(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 < 1\}$ and on the right is the image of that disk under the map $f(x, y) = \frac  {1}{1 - |x^2 + y^2|}.$ Note that when working with the Poincaré metric, we don't "see" this surface. We are like an ant living on it and can only observe the effects. To us, it is like we are still living on a disk, but the distance between two points on the disk is different: take $p_0 = \mathbf  {0}$, the origin, and take a point $p$ on $\gamma (t)$ close to $\partial D$. When the disk is equipped with the standard Euclidean metric, the distance between $p_0$ and such $p$ is bounded above by 1. With the Poincaré , as $f$ has a ring asymptote for $(x, y)$ close to $\partial D$, the distance between $p$ and $p_0$ becomes unbounded.}}}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
