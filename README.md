 (Perhaps lecture) Notes for Geometric Function Theory by Steven Krantz. This with GMT are prerequisites for several complex variables and some PDE theory I'm working on. 

 Also, I did a lecture on fixed points of analytic functions, you can check that out at my ORCiD. The theory of that uses the Schwarz Lemma from this book. Pretty interesting. I also want to study more about composition operators, so this book has more than one use. 

 I'm sure nobody is actually reading this sooo aisodfn aisujodfn jaousdvh faojsdhfvjinwehuifvwheuifhsdul;ivbnf jasdfjasdbfbwjsalbfg /sdf
